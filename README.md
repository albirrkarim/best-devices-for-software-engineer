Here are the devices that I use to work

I'm a programmer, I'm playing in the field of web development, system architecture, AI stuff, computer vision,

All of my work you can see on my GitHub is done with these devices:

A. Macbook Air M1, 8GB/256GB

Why i choose 8GB/256GB? Why is it the best choice for budget ?

I need speed for node js development, so I chose Apple m1.
I just use this MacBook to develop something, I keep 3 - 5 projects in this Macbook. the project that has been done (older) I move it into my external SSD.
I also moved the unused Application to an external SSD. YES, you can move Mac apps just by doing drag and drop with Finder easily, even you can open your apps from an external SSD.

Because the higher memory in Apple costs INSANE. I just bought an external SSD.

B. SSD External Sandisk 500GB With speed 1050MB/s

Why sandisk extreme 500GB and 1050 MB of speed?
Because it fast and best value.

Sometimes you want to open an old project (node js) and just run the server from an external SSD, it just works and the building process (npm run dev/ npm run build) is fast (like if you put in you mac storage)

Here is the link i recommend if you want to buy SSD External Sandisk 500GB With speed 1050MB/s:

C. Ipad Pro M1, 8GB / 128GB. 11 Inch

Again, I don't like the size of the storage. I just need a fast CPU and many sensors to support AR development.

I use Ipad for my mobile second monitor, so I can bring it to a coffee shop.

Apple Pencil Gen 2

I use this apple pencil to draw, give illustrations, teaching.

D. Samsung Galaxy A53. 8GB/128

Here the Points what i consider to buy this phone:

- When we talk about phone, i trust good brand, and its Samsung.

- I buy this when the A54 not released yet. if the A54 has release i would prefer buy A54.

- I use this phone for giving mobile hotspot, testing web, and trying AR (but its laggy not like the iphone 11 do)

- Not using camera frequently and looking for the best camera, because I'm a programmer.

- The main reasons why i prefer android is the USB TYPE C, what apple ? you just selling iPhone 15 with USB C? and it cost so expensive?
  When you go outside like coding in cafe of coffee shop you need one type of USB port. the Macbook and the Ipad is using Type C.
  So your phone must be type C also. you can just bring one charger and one cable for all devices.

So buy A54 instead of A53, i see the review is it has better performance and adaptive refresh rate.

E. Charger Slim and cable 2M

Choosing the best charger, for all my devices, all is USB Type C.
